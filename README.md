  <img src="Schneider.Timon_02.png" alt="Menu UI Screenshot" width="600">
  <p>In the Menu i tried to depict everything the player needs to know: 
    There is a description of what to do in the top left:
    > Kill All Xenos
    > Recover the Grimoire
    > Be As Efficient as Possible
    </p>
  <p>I also wanted to show all the Interactable Objects like the Enemies, the Healing Item and the Grimoire. Additionally the grenade and the bullets are interactable Objects as well</p>
  <p>On the top right i showed the controlls of the game - Additionally the player uses the cursor to shoot bullets and aim where the grenade goes!</p>

### Enemies 👾:
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="EnemySprites.png" alt="Enemy Spritesheet" width="500">
  <p>The EnemySpritesheet was completely original from me, trying to make them look like they come from the tanks that are placed in the level with blue liquid still coming out of there back-tubes.</p>
    <img src="Enemydead.png" alt="Enemy Spritesheet" width="500">
    <p>This is what the Enemies look like when they die.</p>
</div>

### The Grenade 💣:

### The Maps:

    <p>This is the whole level layout - Player has to go from left to right.</p>
    <img src="background3.png" alt="Enemy Spritesheet" width="800">
  <p>This is what the Main Menu looks like. I wanted the player to be able to move in the main menu so i created a smaller version of the main Map.</p>

## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** The theme and style came together seamlessly, and the sprites were fun to design.
- **Core Mechanics:** The gravity-based gameplay worked better than expected and provided a unique challenge.

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** Implementing all the features we envisioned wasn’t possible due to the limited timeframe.
- **Bug Fixes:** Handling collisions and edge cases for gravity mechanics was tricky.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Prototyping Matters:** Testing early prototypes helped refine the core mechanics quickly.
- **Keep it Simple:** Focusing on one unique mechanic instead of multiple features made the game more polished.
