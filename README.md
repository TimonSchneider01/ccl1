  <img src="Schneider.Timon_02.png" alt="Menu UI Screenshot" width="600">
  <p>In the Menu i tried to depict everything the player needs to know: 
    There is a description of what to do in the top left:
    > Kill All Xenos
    > Recover the Grimoire
    > Be As Efficient as Possible
    </p>
  <p>I also wanted to show all the Interactable Objects like the Enemies, the Healing Item and the Grimoire. Additionally the grenade and the bullets are interactable Objects as well</p>
  <p>On the top right i showed the controlls of the game - Additionally the player uses the cursor to shoot bullets and aim where the grenade goes!</p>

## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** The theme and style came together seamlessly, and the sprites were fun to design.
- **Core Mechanics:** The gravity-based gameplay worked better than expected and provided a unique challenge.

### Challenges:
- **Time Constraints:** Implementing all the features we envisioned wasn’t possible due to the limited timeframe.
- **Bug Fixes:** Handling collisions and edge cases for gravity mechanics was tricky.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Prototyping Matters:** Testing early prototypes helped refine the core mechanics quickly.
- **Keep it Simple:** Focusing on one unique mechanic instead of multiple features made the game more polished.
