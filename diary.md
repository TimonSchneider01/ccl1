13.01.2025:

1) Extending from the (not)JumpnRun file we created in class
2) Added an Eventlistener that tracks where the Player presses the mouse on the canvas
3) Added the background function that calculates the unity vector and mulitplies it so the velocity of
   the bullet is always the same
4) Edited the applGravity function so the bullets bounce of walls and stay on the ground
5) Added an enemy class and collisiondetection. Bullets that lay on the ground no longer affect enemy
   class
6) Altered gravityFunction so Player no longer warps up walls or Obstacles
